Certainly! You can use the Script Editor web part to inject your JavaScript directly into the child form. Follow these steps:

1. Open the child form (`editform.aspx`) in SharePoint Designer.

2. Insert a Script Editor web part on the child form where you want to add your custom JavaScript.

3. Edit the HTML content of the Script Editor web part and insert your custom JavaScript code. Here's an example:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    // Customize the delete button action
    function customDeleteAction() {
        // Your delete logic here, e.g., using SharePoint REST API to delete the item

        // After successful deletion, close the popup dialog
        SP.UI.ModalDialog.commonModalDialogClose(SP.UI.DialogResult.OK);
    }

    // Add a custom action to the ribbon for the delete button
    function addCustomDeleteButtonAction() {
        var deleteButton = document.getElementById("Ribbon.ListForm.Edit.DeleteItem-Large");

        if (deleteButton) {
            // Attach your custom delete function to the delete button
            deleteButton.onclick = customDeleteAction;
        }
    }

    // Execute the custom action when the page loads
    _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames.push("addCustomDeleteButtonAction");
</script>
```

Make sure to replace `"Ribbon.ListForm.Edit.DeleteItem-Large"` with the actual ID of the delete button on your child form.

Save and check in the form, then test the functionality. Remember to thoroughly test it in a development or testing environment before applying it to your production site.
