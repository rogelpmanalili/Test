To achieve the desired layout in SharePoint 2013 survey app by moving questions side by side, you can use custom CSS with the help of a Script Editor or Content Editor web part. Follow these steps:

1. **Add a Script Editor or Content Editor Web Part:**
   - Edit the page where your survey is located.
   - Add a Script Editor or Content Editor web part to the page.

2. **Insert Custom CSS:**
   - Edit the Script Editor or Content Editor web part.
   - Insert the following CSS code:

    ```css
    <style type="text/css">
        /* Adjust the width as needed */
        .ms-formtable tr {
            display: flex;
        }

        .ms-formtable td {
            flex: 1;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
    </style>
    ```

3. **Identify the Questions' IDs:**
   - Right-click on the question you want to move, and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from your browser. This will open the browser's developer tools.
   - Look for the `id` attribute of the HTML element corresponding to each question. It will look something like `id="..."`. Note down the IDs for Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, and Question 4.

4. **Adjust the CSS for Specific Questions:**
   - Edit the Script Editor or Content Editor web part.
   - Modify the CSS code to target the specific questions and move them side by side:

    ```css
    <style type="text/css">
        /* Adjust the width as needed */
        .ms-formtable tr {
            display: flex;
        }

        #YOUR_QUESTION_1_ID,
        #YOUR_QUESTION_2_ID,
        #YOUR_QUESTION_3_ID,
        #YOUR_QUESTION_4_ID {
            flex: 1;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
    </style>
    ```

   - Replace `YOUR_QUESTION_1_ID`, `YOUR_QUESTION_2_ID`, `YOUR_QUESTION_3_ID`, and `YOUR_QUESTION_4_ID` with the actual IDs you noted down for each question.

5. **Save and Check:**
   - Save the changes to the Script Editor or Content Editor web part.
   - Check the page to see if the questions are now displayed side by side.

Please note that this solution assumes that the survey questions are arranged in a table structure. If the structure of your survey is different, you might need to adjust the CSS accordingly. Additionally, make sure to test the changes in a safe environment before applying them to a production site.
