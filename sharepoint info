Here's a brief response to address your boss's questions:

1. **Popular Companies Using SharePoint:**
   - Many large companies across various industries use SharePoint, including Microsoft itself, Accenture, Deloitte, Boeing, and Walmart.

2. **Competing Technologies/Languages Against SharePoint:**
   - While SharePoint is a popular choice for collaboration and document management, alternatives include platforms like Atlassian Confluence, Google Workspace, and custom-built solutions using various technologies such as Java, Python, or Ruby on Rails.

3. **Choosing Between SharePoint and Custom Development:**
   - Whether to use SharePoint or develop a new system from scratch depends on factors like specific requirements, budget, timeline, and available expertise.
   - SharePoint offers out-of-the-box features and rapid development capabilities, suitable for quick deployment and integration with other Microsoft technologies.
   - Custom development using C# and Visual Basic provides more flexibility and customization options but requires more time and resources.

4. **License Choice:**
   - Choosing between Microsoft licenses or open-source solutions depends on factors like budget, support requirements, and compatibility with existing infrastructure.
   - Microsoft licenses offer comprehensive support, integration with other Microsoft products, and regular updates but come with associated costs.
   - Open-source solutions can provide cost savings and flexibility but may require more technical expertise for setup, customization, and maintenance.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on a thorough evaluation of the organization's needs, resources, and strategic objectives. Consulting with IT experts or conducting a feasibility study can help in making an informed decision.
